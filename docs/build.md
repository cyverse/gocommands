# Building GoCommands from Source

To build GoCommands from source code, you'll need the following prerequisites:

- `make`
- `go` (version 1.22 or newer)

## Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the root directory of the source tree
3. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   make build
   ```
4. The GoCommands binary will be generated in the `bin` directory

You can then run the binary directly from this location or add it to your PATH for system-wide access.
