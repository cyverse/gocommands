# Upgrading GoCommands

Keeping GoCommands up to date ensures you have the latest features and bug fixes. To upgrade to the latest version, follow these steps:  

1. Run the upgrade command:  
   ```bash
   gocmd upgrade
   ```  

2. If GoCommands is installed in a system directory, you may need administrative privileges. On Unix-like systems, use:  
   ```bash
