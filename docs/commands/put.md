# Upload Data to iRODS

The `put` command allows you to upload data objects (files) and collections (directories) from your local system to iRODS. It is similar to the `cp` command in Unix but operates between your local file system and iRODS.

## Syntax
```sh
gocmd put [flags] <local-files-or-dir>... <dest-data-object-or-collection>
```

> **Note:** If the local destination is not specified, the current working directory is used as the destination.

## Example Usage

1. **Upload a single file:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put /local/path/file.txt /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads the file `/local/path/file.txt` to `/myZone/home/myUser/`, creating `/myZone/home/myUser/file.txt` in iRODS.

2. **Upload a directory and its contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads the contents of the directory `/local/dir` to `/myZone/home/myUser/dir` in iRODS. The uploaded files and subdirectories will be placed within the `/myZone/home/myUser/dir` folder.

3. **Upload a data object to a specific iRODS path:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put /local/path/file.txt /myZone/home/myUser/specific_file.txt
    ```

4. **Upload with progress bars:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --progress /local/path/largefile.dat /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

5. **Force upload:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put -f /local/path/largefile.dat /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command overwrites the existing file in iRODS without prompting.

6. **Upload and verify checksum:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put -K /local/path/important_data.txt /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads the file and verifies its integrity by calculating a checksum during transfer.

7. **Upload only different or new contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --diff /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads only files that are different or don't exist in the destination. It compares file sizes and checksums to determine which files need updating.

8. **Upload only different or new contents without calculating hash:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --diff --no_hash /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command skips hash calculations and compares only file sizes for faster synchronization.

9. **Upload via iCAT:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --icat /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uses iCAT as a transfer broker, useful when direct access to the resource server is unstable.

10. **Upload via resource server:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --redirect /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command bypasses the iCAT server for data transfer, directly accessing the specified resource server for optimized performance.

11. **Upload with specified transfer threads:**
    ```sh
    gocmd put --thread_num 15 /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uses up to 15 threads for data transfer, requiring more CPU power and RAM.

12. **Upload and generate report:** 
    ```sh
    gocmd put --report report.json /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads files from the local directory to iRODS and generates a JSON report containing details such as paths, file sizes, checksums, and transfer methods.
