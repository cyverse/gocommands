# Bundle Upload Data to iRODS

The `bput` command allows you to efficiently upload multiple small files by bundling them into tar archives before transfer to iRODS. This is particularly useful for directories containing many small files.

## Syntax
```sh
gocmd bput [flags] <local-files-or-dir>... <dest-collection>
```

> **Note:** If the local destination is not specified, the current working directory is used as the destination.

## Example Usage

1. **Upload a directory and its contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

2. **Upload with progress bars:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --progress /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

3. **Force upload:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput -f /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command overwrites the existing file in iRODS without prompting.

4. **Upload only different or new contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --diff /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads only files that are different or don't exist in the destination. It compares file sizes and checksums to determine which files need updating.

5. **Upload only different or new contents without calculating hash:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --diff --no_hash /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command skips hash calculations and compares only file sizes for faster synchronization.

6. **Upload via iCAT:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --icat /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uses iCAT as a transfer broker, useful when direct access to the resource server is unstable.

7. **Upload via resource server:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --redirect /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command bypasses the iCAT server for data transfer, directly accessing the specified resource server for optimized performance.

8. **Upload with specified transfer threads:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --thread_num 15 /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uses up to 15 threads for data transfer, requiring more CPU power and RAM.

9. **Upload and generate report:** 
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --report report.json /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads files from the local directory to iRODS and generates a JSON report containing details such as paths, file sizes, checksums, and transfer methods.

10. **Upload with specified maximum file count per bundle:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --max_file_num 100 /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads files from the local directory to iRODS by creating bundles containing up to 100 files each.

11. **Upload with specified mininum file count per bundle:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --min_file_num 50 /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads files from the local directory to iRODS by creating bundles containing at least 50 files each.

12. **Upload with specified maximum bundle file size:**
    ```sh
    gocmd bput --max_file_size 10GB /local/dir /myZone/home/myUser/
    ```

    This command uploads files from the local directory to iRODS by creating bundles with a maximum size of 10GB each.
