# Download Data From iRODS

The `get` command allows you to download data objects and collections from iRODS to your local system. It is similar to the `cp` command in Unix but operates between iRODS and your local file system.

## Syntax
```sh
gocmd get [flags] <data-object-or-collection>... <dest-local-file-or-dir> 
```

> **Note:** If the local path is not specified, the current working directory is used as the destination.

## Example Usage

1. **Download a single data object:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get /myZone/home/myUser/file.txt
    ```

2. **Download a collection and its contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get i:/local/dir
    ```

3. **Download a data object to a specific local path:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get /myZone/home/myUser/file.txt /local/path/file.txt
    ```

4. **Download with progress bars:**
    ```sh
    text
    gocmd get --progress /myZone/home/myUser/largefile.dat
    ```

5. **Force download:**
    ```sh
    text
    gocmd get -f /myZone/home/myUser/largefile.dat
    ```

    This command overwrites the local file without prompting if it already exists.

6. **Download and verify checksum:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get -K /myZone/home/myUser/important_data.txt
    ```

    This command downloads the file and verifies its integrity by calculating the checksum after download and comparing it with the original in iRODS. This ensures data consistency and detects any corruption during transfer.

7. **Download only different or new contents:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get --diff /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command downloads the source collection to the local directory, transferring only files that are different or don't exist locally. It compares file sizes and checksums to determine which files need updating, making the transfer more efficient by skipping unchanged files.

8. **Download only different or new contents without calculating hash:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get --diff --no_hash /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command downloads the source collection to the local directory, transferring only files that are different or don't exist locally. It skips hash calculations and compares only file sizes for faster synchronization

9. **Download via iCAT:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get --icat /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command uses iCAT as a transfer broker, which is useful when direct access to the resource server is unstable. It ensures reliable data transfer by routing through the iCAT server

10. **Download via resource server:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get --redirect /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command bypasses the iCAT server for data transfer, directly accessing the specified resource server. It optimizes performance for large files by direct connection to the resource server.

11. **Download with specifying transfer threads:**
    ```sh
    gocmd get --thread_num 15 /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command uses up to 15 threads for data transfer, requiring more CPU power and RAM.

12. **Download with wildcard:** 
    ```sh
    gocmd get -w /myZone/home/myUser/dir/file*.txt /local/dir
    ```

    This command downloads all files matching the pattern "file*.txt" from the specified iRODS collection to the local directory.

13. **Download and generate report:** 
    ```sh
    gocmd get --report report.json /myZone/home/myUser/dir /local/dir
    ```

    This command downloads the source collection to the local directory and generates a JSON report file containing transfer details such as paths, file sizes, checksums, and transfer methods.
